                <p>Welcome to Revolution Idle! In this game, you’ll embark on an exciting journey where your clicks drive the revolution towards Infinity. As you progress, you’ll earn Points for every milestone you reach, which will help you unlock powerful upgrades and bonuses. These Points are key to progressing faster and unlocking new features in the game.</p>

                <p>Connect your Xion Wallet to the game to seamlessly store and manage your Xion Coins. Earn Xion Coins by redeeming your Points, which can be used to unlock exclusive in-game content, such as new abilities, upgrades, or boosting your progression speed. The more Points you earn, the greater the rewards you can unlock with Xion Coins!</p>

                <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Earn Points:</strong> As you click and progress, you accumulate Points that can be used to unlock new features.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redeem Points for Xion Coins:</strong> You can convert your hard-earned Points into Xion Coins, which are a valuable in-game currency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Upgrade and Prestige:</strong> Use Xion Coins to purchase powerful upgrades or prestige your character for a fresh start with bonuses!</li>
                    <li><strong>Connect Your Wallet:</strong> Link your Xion Wallet to store your Xion Coins and access exclusive rewards.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Your goal is to keep clicking, earning Points, and converting them into Xion Coins to maximize your progress. The higher your Xion Coin collection, the greater your ability to unlock special powers, access limited-time events, and progress faster in the game.</p>

                <p>Start your revolution now, and remember—every click counts toward shaping your destiny!</p>
